## Appearance & Mobile Responsiveness Audit (UI/UX)

Date: 2025-08-18

### Visual Design and Branding

- Header logo: crisp and readable; consider adding a clickable link back to home on the logo for familiarity.
- Color/contrast: primary and foreground colors generally meet WCAG; verify contrast of muted text on colored backgrounds, especially in footer and over imagery.
- Spacing rhythm: sections have good vertical rhythm; tighten small gaps in “Why use our products?” feature blocks on small screens to reduce scroll length.
- Typography: headings are clear. Consider slightly larger base font on mobile (e.g., 16–18px) and increase line-height for feature lists.
- Buttons: primary CTAs are prominent; ensure consistent size and radius across pages. Prefer consistent casing (Title vs Sentence case).

### Components and Imagery

- Hero slideshow: strong imagery; ensure each slide’s overlay text remains legible over bright backgrounds (add subtle gradient overlay if needed).
- Feature icons/images in benefits sections: add consistent sizing and spacing; for decorative imagery, ensure `alt=""` to avoid verbosity for screen readers.
- Footer: rich contact details; consider a simplified mobile footer with collapsible sections to reduce perceived density.

### Content Layout per Page

- Home (`/`): strong intro with clear CTAs. Consider placing “Latest Projects” (Instagram) below the hero CTA to focus primary action first.
- Products list (`/products`): add card layout with 2-up grid on small screens, 3–4 on larger. Provide skeletons during load and a refined empty state.
- Product detail (`/products/:slug`): add sticky "Request Quote" or "Contact" CTA bar on mobile for convenience.
- Latest (`/latest`): add article cards with thumbnail, category, date. Ensure tap targets are large and consistent.

### Mobile Responsiveness

- Header/nav: a mobile menu was added (hamburger + slide-over) to expose navigation and CTAs. This resolves the prior issue where nav wasn’t visible on small screens.
- Section anchors: links like `/#services` and `/#about` should scroll reliably on mobile; test navigating from other routes and ensure focus is managed.
- Grids: ensure product lists switch to 1–2 columns on small screens; verify no overflow from long titles or tags.
- Forms: enlarge tap targets, ensure inputs have labels above fields on narrow viewports, and add clear success/error messages.
- Spacing: increase vertical spacing between stacked elements on small screens; keep consistent padding (e.g., 16–20px sides).

### Accessibility Quick Pass

- Interactive elements: ensure all buttons/links have visible focus, adequate size, and clear labels.
- Carousel controls: label slide dots (e.g., "Go to slide 1") and indicate active state with `aria-current`.
- Heading hierarchy: verify sequential heading levels per section.

### Quick Wins

- Add labelled slide dots and maintain keyboard operability.
- Provide skeleton/empty states for product lists and details.
- Add sticky CTA on product detail for mobile.
- Verify contrast of muted text over primary backgrounds.
